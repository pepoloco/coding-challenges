/*1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide 
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but 
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h*/
